excerpt: "In this paper, we propose a neural end-to-end system for voice preserving and lip-synchronous video translation. The system is designed to combine multiple component models and produces a video of the original speaker speaking in the target language that is lip-synchronous with the target speech, yet maintains emphases in speech, voice characteristics, and face video of the original speaker. The result is a video of a speaker speaking in another language without actually knowing it.<br/> <img src='/images/lipdub.png' width=800 height=400>"

In this paper, we propose a neural end-to-end system for voice preserving and lip-synchronous video translation. The system is designed to combine multiple component models and produces a video of the original speaker speaking in the target language that is lip-synchronous with the target speech, yet maintains emphases in speech, voice characteristics, and face video of the original speaker. The result is a video of a speaker speaking in another language without actually knowing it.
