2023-06-04	Face-Dubbing++: Lip-synchronous, voice preserving translation of videos	2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops (ICASSPW)	In this paper, we propose a neural end-to-end system for voice preserving and lip-synchronous video translation. The system is designed to combine multiple component models and produces a video of the original speaker speaking in the target language that is lip-synchronous with the target speech, yet maintains emphases in speech, voice characteristics, and face video of the original speaker. The result is a video of a speaker speaking in another language without actually knowing it.	A.
