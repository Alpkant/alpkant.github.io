I’m a computer science PhD student at Goethe University, in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I work under the supervision of Prof. Gemma Roig and Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh. I am a member of both [CVAI Lab](http://cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de) and [Center for Cognition and Computation Lab](http://www.ccc.cs.uni-frankfurt.de).

My current research focuses on studying how to build robust and explainable AI systems that are interacting with humans in an educational setting. 

During my Master's and Bachelor's I have studied on facial biometrics using AI and computer vision systems. You can see my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/).

* My interests are:
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Computer Vision
  * Explainability
  * Multimodal Learning
  * Disentanglement
